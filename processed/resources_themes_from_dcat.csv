Given access to high-quality data from computations and/or experiments, machine learning can be used to develop expert systems powered by large language models (such as ChatGPT). These expert systems can be to train surrogate models that can predict properties of structures, eliminating the need for simulations, or speed up simulations by using machine learnt interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The Data to Knowledge resource theme is dedicated to making the creation of these models possible by providing data infrastructure and workflows enabling the generation and exploitation of these machine learnt models. 
The Data to Knowledge collections comprise curated datasets designed for use in machine learning or generated through machine learning. An example is the Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) data collection, which includes MLIPs XYZ files used for training, the trained model itself, and, where possible, related data such as AIIDA provenance records. Making these datasets available enables those without the resources to compute data themselves to utilise them for machine learning and modelling. Training is a central focus of this resource theme. We provide two types of training: general training and tool-specific training. Our general training is provided as self-paced learning online."
