## Dependencies

The public website deployed by this project depends on the assets made public by PSDI's common style project at https://github.com/PSDI-UK/psdi-common-style. Any changes to these assets will be reflected in this project's website, and this project should ideally be tested with any changes before they're made live. An issue with retrieving these assets will appear as the website appear unstyled and missing its header and footer.

In case these assets become no longer available for some reason, the commit `517e74b99fba4920c4eea4b17131fdd42eb93f72` can be used as a reference to restore local versions of them.
