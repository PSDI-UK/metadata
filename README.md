## Summary
The PSDI metadata describes the [Physical Sciences Data Infrastructure (PSDI)](https://www.psdi.ac.uk/ ) project.  
This is its working version.
The metadata is made available in [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format, and guidance files describing for anyone who wants to use or contribute to it are available in the [https://github.com/orgs/PSDI-UK/guidance/](https://github.com/orgs/PSDI-UK/guidance/) folder.
A major source of guidance and reference in structuring and populating this metadata was version 1 of  [Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF)](https://worldfair-project.eu/):
* [vocabulary.jsonld](./vocabulary.jsonld) corresponds to the CORE CONTROLLED VOCABULARY profile
* [catalogue.jsonld](./catalogue.jsonld) corresponds to the CORE DISCOVERY profile
