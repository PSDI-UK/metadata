DL_MONTE supports many Monte Carlo methods, including grand-canonical Monte Carlo and advanced free energy methods such as Wang-Landau. Moreover it supports a many types of interatomic interactions and hence can be used to model a wide range of materials and fluids. This image can be used to execute DL_MONTE simulations using DL_MONTE input files on their computer. This might be more appealing to a user than using a DL_MONTE binary, something which the user must typically compile from the source code themselves."

To do this efficiently, researchers may need to use specialist software which is difficult for them to set up on the computer systems they use for their research. Our tool packages various pieces of software for transferring data to /from S3 storage - a type of  storage commonly employed in cloud computing -  into a single container image. This enables researchers to transfer data to/from S3 storage more easily, without the hassle of installing the various pieces of software themselves on their computer systems."

The predicted properties include: melting point, boiling point, density, logP, solubility, polarizability and more. It will also predict the IUPAC name for the molecule. The properties are predicted through a variety of algorithms, including RDKit algorithms: Semi-empirical quantum methods; Fragment/ atom  contribution calculations; Bayesian Additive Regression Trees; Transformer neural networks.
The predicted value is returned in the results interface. For those properties predicted using the Bayesian algorithms it also returns an interval for the 95% confidence, along with a measure of how well the molecule compares to molecules contained in the training set. Where a property prediction is deemed non-sensical due to the predicted phase, the property may be omitted from results.
Propersea performs best for organic compounds and performance on inorganics, orgometallics and inorganic-organic mixtures is known to be lower. Reliability metrics for these compounds would show as ‘Low’ or ‘Very Low’"

A query can be performed to find data associated with any general substance (via its chemical formulae; name; number of elements) and this search can be enhanced by a more detailed search for specific elemental composition using a periodic table interface. In addition, more specialised searches are also available if the substance is known to be made up of molecules, take a crystalline form, or display other bulk symmetry or periodicity based on fields relevant to those. When data search results are returned, summary information is shown for each, and a link to the source of the data (authentication may be requireds to access these)."
