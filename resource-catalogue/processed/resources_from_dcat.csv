Galaxy is a platform for FAIR data analysis that enable users to: run code in interactive environments; share and publish results, workflows and their associated visualizations; and ensure the reproducibility of their results by capturing and packaging data, metadata and provenance models required for repeating and understanding their data analyses. We are initially working with muon science and catalysis experiments, but plan to expand the methodology to other large scale experiments."

Physical Sciences Data-Science Service (PSDS),Propersea (Property Prediction),dcat:Dataset,https://www.psds.ac.uk/propersea,"Propersea is a online resource (currently in end stage testing) designed to provide predictions for a range of molecular and physicochemical properties for small molecules. The predicted properties include: melting point, boiling point, density, logP, solubility, polarizability and more. It will also predict the IUPAC name for the molecule. The properties are predicted through a variety of algorithms, including RDKit algorithms: Semi-empirical quantum methods; Fragment/ atom  contribution calculations; Bayesian Additive Regression Trees; Transformer neural networks.
The predicted value is returned in the results interface. For those properties predicted using the Bayesian algorithms it also returns an interval for the 95% confidence, along with a measure of how well the molecule compares to molecules contained in the training set. Where a property prediction is deemed non-sensical due to the predicted phase, the property may be omitted from results.
Propersea performs best for organic compounds and performance on inorganics, orgometallics and inorganic-organic mixtures is known to be lower. Reliability metrics for these compounds would show as ‘Low’ or ‘Very Low’"
