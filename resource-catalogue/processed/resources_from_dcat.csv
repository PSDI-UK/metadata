Data Sources for PSDI Data Cross Search,Propersea (Property Prediction),Data,https://www.psds.ac.uk/propersea,http://www.psdi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PSDI_Logo_CMYK-01.svg,"Propersea is a online resource (currently in end stage testing) designed to provide predictions for a range of molecular and physicochemical properties for small molecules. The predicted properties include: melting point, boiling point, density, logP, solubility, polarizability and more. It will also predict the IUPAC name for the molecule. The properties are predicted through a variety of algorithms, including RDKit algorithms: Semi-empirical quantum methods; Fragment/ atom  contribution calculations; Bayesian Additive Regression Trees; Transformer neural networks.
The predicted value is returned in the results interface. For those properties predicted using the Bayesian algorithms it also returns an interval for the 95% confidence, along with a measure of how well the molecule compares to molecules contained in the training set. Where a property prediction is deemed non-sensical due to the predicted phase, the property may be omitted from results.
Propersea performs best for organic compounds and performance on inorganics, orgometallics and inorganic-organic mixtures is known to be lower. Reliability metrics for these compounds would show as ‘Low’ or ‘Very Low’"
