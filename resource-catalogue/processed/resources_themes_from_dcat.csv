Open Materials Micrograph Repository,http://micrograph.royce.ac.uk,"The Open Materials Micrograph Repository (OM2R) is a free and open repository for materials micrographs and nanographs. We support optical light microscopy and electron microscopy, covering scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). OM2R is free and open to query on the front-end without registration. Account registration is required to submit your data, and use the API features on OM2R. OM2R is supported by the MIDAS Programme Grant, Physical Sciences Data Infrastructure (PSDI) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Please use the PSDI contact form (http://www.psdi.ac.uk/contact/) if you have any feature suggestions, or want to get involved."
Thematic portal,http://github.com/UK-Catalysis-Hub/ukcathubapp,"Thematic portal to display summary report of output publications and impact of a specified theme (based on grant) or insitution. Example instances are available for ""Catalysis Hub"" outputs but tools are available to start other instances with other themes. Displaying Publications, Authors, Institution versus year, top researchers, distribution by country and theme. Output from PSDI Pathfinder 1."
PSDI Data Conversion,http://data-conversion.psdi.ac.uk/,"Your one stop shop for file format conversion. PSDI's Data Conversion Service will enable users to seamlessly convert between different file formats and recieve information about the quality of the conversion. This functionality is available as: A PSDI Hosted Web Application, a containerised web app that can be run as a standalone application outside of PSDI, a PSDI Command Line service, and source code for installing and running in your own pipelines. Output from PSDI Pathfinder 2."
PSDI Data Revival,http://www.data-revival.psdi.ac.uk,"Data Revival enables you to seamlessly convert your handwritten lab book pages into machine-readable data, pulling out the important chemistry knowledge. Output from PSDI Pathfinder 2."
PSDI Digital Lab Notebook Resources,http://psdi-uk.github.io/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/notebooks/,"This knowledgebase section contains in-depth information about all aspects of process recording, ranging from information and exemplars on Research Data Management and FAIR Data [Check with Cerys that this does intend to go here...], and detailed guidance on how to select and implement Digital Lab Notebooks, including both generic notebooking tools and Electronic Lab Notebooks. There are links to full lists of the different software available, tools to aid with selection, and case studies of successful Digital Lab Notebook implementations, and an interactive demo of the UoS ELN LabTrove to demonstrate how it is being used as a living example. This is an Output from PSDI Pathfinder 2."
Building Data Collections,http://github.com/PSDI-UK/psdi-datasets/tree/main,"This resource holds both the useful data collections that have been created and curated from a variety of sources to be made available to the community, and the data exemplars that have been developed as part of our case studies to investigate different methods of improving data capture, quality and sharing, and how to resurrect legacy data in a meaningful manner."
BioSim (Biomolecular Simulations) Data Resources,http://UrlForPF4sBitOfPSDIInvenio,"A collection of tools and services for biomolecular simulation data provenance capture, sharing and exploring. Output from PSDI Pathfinder 4."
Data to Knowledge,http://data-collections.psdi.ac.uk/communities/mlip,"Machine Learning in the materials modelling have revolutionised and transformed the field in the last few years. Based on availability of good data from computations and/or experiment one can use machine learning to train expert systems using large language models (Ã  la chatGPT), train surrogate models to predict properties or structure avoiding the use of simulations or simply speed up simulations by using machine learnt interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our path finder is dedicated to making possible the creation of these models by providing data infrastructure, workflows for creation and exploitation of machine learnt models. Output from PSDI Pathfinder 5."
Collaborative Computational Project for NMR Crystallography (CCP-NC),http://www.ccpnc.ac.uk/database/,"The Collaborative Computational Project for NMR Crystallography (CCP-NC) combines experimental NMR and computation to provide new insight, with atomic resolution, into structure, disorder, and dynamics in the solid state. Output from PSDI Pathfinder 6."
Galaxy workflow management system,http://materialsgalaxy.stfc.ac.uk/,"The post-processing of experimental and simulation data, associated to large scale experiments performed at national facilities, requires that different software tools from various domains are connected into workflows.  These workflows can be quite complex and, in this pathfinder, we will be using the open-source, web-based Galaxy platform to manage the software tools and data associated to these workflows. Galaxy is a platform for FAIR data analysis that enable users to: run code in interactive environments; share and publish results, workflows and their associated visualizations; and ensure the reproducibility of their results by capturing and packaging data, metadata and provenance models required for repeating and understanding their data analyses. We are initially working with muon science and catalysis experiments, but plan to expand the methodology to other large scale experiments."
